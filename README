== Abaci

Abaci is a math library written specifically for 3d video game development.
It strives to be:

    * Standalone - It is not dependent on anything other then the c++ standard library.
    * Streamlined - Tailored to the problems of 3d game development; it is not a generic math library.
    * Portable - Not tied to a specific os or compiler.
    * Fast - Use langauge features such as inlines & templates to achieve acceptable performance.

Supports basic math primitives:

    * 4x4 Matrices for coordinate transformations
    * Quaternions for rotations
    * Vectors of two, three & four elements
    * Complex number arithmetic.
